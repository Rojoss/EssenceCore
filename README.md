## Issues with Spigot versions ##
If you are a contributor, and dont have spigot (not spigot-api) artifacts on your local repository, you will have errors.
To solve this make sure you have used buildtools to compile 1.8, 1.8.3 and 1.8.8 versions of spigot server atleast once.
This is subject to change as new nms versions may come and there spigot versions maybe needed.
